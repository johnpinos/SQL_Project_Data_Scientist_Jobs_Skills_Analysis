# Context
The objective of this analysis is to identify which technical skills offer the highest return in terms of salary and demand within the data science field, in order to support strategic decisions in professional development.

The data used is from Luke Barousse's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql) and has been adapted to focus specifically on Data Scientist roles.

### Key Questions
The SQL queries developed in this project aim to answer the following core questions:

1. What are the highest-paying Data Scientist positions?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying roles?
3. Which competencies are most in demand for Data Scientists today?
4. Which skills are associated with the highest average salaries?
5. Which skills are most strategic when considering both demand and compensation?

# Tools Used
To efficiently and systematically analyze the data science job market, the following tools were employed:

- **SQL:** The primary language for extracting, transforming, and analyzing job posting data.
- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system selected for its robustness, reliability, and widespread adoption in professional environments.
- **Visual Studio Code:** The development environment used to write and execute SQL queries, offering flexibility and strong extension support.
- **Git and GitHub:** Essential tools for version control, project documentation, and publishing the analysis in an organized and transparent manner.

# Analysis

### 5. Optimal Skills: High Demand and High Salary
This analysis identifies the most strategic skills for data scientists by combining two key criteria: high job demand and high average salary. The study focused exclusively on remote jobs with specified compensation

```sql
WITH skills_demand AS( 
    SELECT 
        sjd.skill_id,
        sd.skills,
        COUNT(sjd.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM job_postings_fact jpf
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim sjd ON jpf.job_id = sjd.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim sd ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' 
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = True 
    GROUP BY sjd.skill_id, sd.skills
), 
average_salary AS(
    SELECT 
        sjd.skill_id,
        sd.skills,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
    FROM job_postings_fact jpf
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim sjd ON jpf.job_id = sjd.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim sd ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Scientist'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = True 
    GROUP BY sjd.skill_id, sd.skills
)
SELECT 
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    demand_count,
    avg_salary
FROM
    skills_demand
INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
WHERE  
    demand_count > 10
ORDER BY

# Conclusions
This project enabled the extraction of key insights about the data science job market, with a particular focus on remote positions. Based on the analysis, the following conclusions stand out:

1. **Demand vs. compensation:** Not all high-demand skills are the highest paid. Some, although less popular, offer high profitability.
2. **Essential languages:** Python is established as the indispensable language. SQL remains relevant in nearly every job posting.
3.  **Emerging trends:** Cloud infrastructure, data orchestration, and automation are rising in both demand and salary.
4. **Technical specialization:** Mastering specific technical tools can open opportunities in better-paid and less competitive roles.
5. **Strategic recommendation:** It is advisable to combine widely used skills (Python, SQL) with high-value specializations (cloud, machine learning, automation).

This analysis provides an objective and actionable foundation for planning a professional development path in data science.
