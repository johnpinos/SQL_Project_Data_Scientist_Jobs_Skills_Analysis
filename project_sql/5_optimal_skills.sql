Answer: What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka itâ€™s in high demand and a high-paying skill)?
- Identify skills in high demand and associated with high average salaries for Data Scientist roles
- Concentrates on remote positions with specified salaries
- Why? Targets skills that offer job security (high demand) and financial benefits (high salaries), 
    offering strategic insights for career development in data scientist

Insights: Optimal Skills for Remote Data Scientist Roles (2025)

- Python leads in demand (763 postings, $143,828 avg), confirming its central role in data science.
- Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn combine high demand with strong salaries (above $148K).
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Snowflake, BigQuery) are highly valued, offering average salaries between $149K and $157K.
- Visualization tools such as Tableau and Looker are in strong demand, with Looker standing out for its high compensation ($158,715).
- Less common languages like C and Go command the highest salaries (above $164K), indicating niche, high-value technical roles.

Conclusion: Mastering a balanced stack of programming, ML, cloud, and visualization tools gives Data Scientists a strong competitive edge in remote roles.
