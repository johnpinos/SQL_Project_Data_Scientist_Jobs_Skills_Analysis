Answer: What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka itâ€™s in high demand and a high-paying skill)?
- Identify skills in high demand and associated with high average salaries for Data Scientist roles
- Concentrates on remote positions with specified salaries
- Why? Targets skills that offer job security (high demand) and financial benefits (high salaries), 
    offering strategic insights for career development in data scientist

Optimal Skills for Remote Data Scientist Roles:

 - Python stands out as the most in-demand skill (763 mentions) with a competitive average salary of $143,828, solidifying its status as the essential language in data science.
 - SQL also shows very high demand (591 mentions) and a strong average salary of $142,833, making it a key tool for database manipulation.
 - R maintains a considerable presence (394 mentions) with a solid average salary of $137,885, proving useful for advanced statistical analysis.
 - Tableau, although less in demand (219 mentions), offers an above-average salary ($146,970), making it a valuable tool for data visualization.
 - AWS and Azure, the leading cloud platforms, show a combination of good demand (217 and 122 mentions, respectively) and high salaries, especially AWS with an average of $149,630, reflecting its importance in modern data environments.
 - Spark, with 149 mentions and an average salary of $150,188, is a well-paid technology focused on processing large volumes of data.
 - TensorFlow and PyTorch, two leading machine learning frameworks, combine high salaries ($151,536 and $152,603, respectively) with solid technical demand (126 and 115 mentions), positioning themselves as key tools in predictive model development.
 - Pandas, while more modest in demand (113 mentions), offers a competitive salary of $144,816 and is essential for data analysis in Python.
 
Conclusion: Mastering a balanced stack of programming, ML, cloud, and visualization tools gives Data Scientists a strong competitive edge in remote roles.
